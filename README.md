### Project Title
Explore bikeshare data

### Description
This project required understanding of python & pandas to explore data related to bike share ride data for three major cities in the United States 
â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I had to write code in order to :
	(1) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics,
	(2) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
